# MG HOTDOG
He's smart, sexy, and always available

## Getting Him Running
1) Define CAMPFIRE_TOKEN and CAMPFIRE_ROOM environmental variables  
2) run bin/mg_hotdog  
3) Talk to him  

## Adding "Parts"

Adding a part is as simple as creating a class in lib/mg_hotdog/parts that implements the Part
interface. To Create a Part that says hello when asked you would define
a class as follows:

```ruby

  class HelloPart
    def process(message, robot)
      robot.speak("MG Hotdog says hello #{message.user.name}") 
    end
  end

```

You can then add the part to the robot by editing bin/mg_hotdog

```ruby

require 'mg_hotdog/parts/hello_part'
robot.listen /hello mg_hotdog/i, HelloPart.new

```
And that is all it takes. 

##Notes
* I removed Redis because I desided to use the composition pattern
  instead

* It's a multi purpose hotdog... you can eat it, you can burn it to make pretty colors, you can even make a VW Bug engine block out of it
