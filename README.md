# MG HOTDOG
He's smart, sexy, and always available

## Getting Him Running
1) Install Redis on your machine  
2) run bin/mg_hotdog  
3) Talk to him  

##Notes
* Dont' Bitch about Redis. It's Pub/Sub means we can use good OO code
  and keep our client nice and small and just have a 1 to many message
  to a bunch of classes that can all be listening for messages 

* It's a multi purpose hotdog... you can eat it, you can burn it to make pretty colors, you can even make a VW Bug engine block out of it
